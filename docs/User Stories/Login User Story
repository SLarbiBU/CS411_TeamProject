User Story 2: Login/Authentication

Upon reaching the home page of the website, the user will be presented with basic information about the website. This info will be about 
the utility of the site and will inform the new visitor about how to use the site. The user will also be presented with a login button. 
Upon clicking this button, the user will be redirected to a twitter authentication page where they are prompted to enter their credentials for 
twitter. If the credentials are incorrect, the user will be redirected back to the same page and an error message will be displayed to 
indicate incorrect credentials. If the login is successful, the user will be redirected to the user home page, which will present basic information
about the user and provide them options such as planning a new night out or viewing the weather.
