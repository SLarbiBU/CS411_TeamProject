# User Story 1

* As a User, I can log in to the app and find something to do according to weather predictions of my current location or 
choice of outing location so that I know what to wear and dont have to separately look at the weather app while getting ready.
The integration of this feature will give me fun recommendations and save me time. The "I'm Broke" attribute is fun and will 
save me money on certain outings when wanting to link one event to another so that even if I'm broke I can still keep the 
night/outing going and have a great time.
