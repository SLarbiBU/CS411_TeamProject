# User Story 3

* As a User, after I've created my itinerary (as detailed in User Story 2), I can choose to accept the plan based on weather information provided to me. Weather predictions based on the location of the event will be shown and I can decide if I choose to accept this itinerary. If I choose to accept it, I will be presented with options of what to wear based on both the weather as well as the dresscode of the event. This will prevent me from having to use a third party application to get weather information. The integration of this feature will give me fun recommendations and save me time.
