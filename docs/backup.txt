Backup Idea: Bucket List Tracker

For this project, we would create a web app that allows the user to create an interactive bucket list for the places they would like to travel. 
The user would input the location of a country/city/landmark that they would like to see. and they would then be presented with different options
upon adding the location. Some options would include an interface to look at available flights and transportation, an interface to look at the 
current weather/climate of the area, and an interface to view public pictures/posts from social media relating to the location. Other possible features
would include a live map of all the different locations on the list, a google calendar to look at for scheduling a trip, a wikipedia interface to 
learn more about the location, and an event locator to see what activities are possible in the surrounding area. The overarching goal is to 
allow the user to create a list of places so they can keep track of these places while also learning more about the locations and potentially planning 
trips.
