Saved Events User Story: 5

Upon seeing an event that i want to attend i will be able to save the event and add it to my saved events (Bookmarked Events). 
Which i can later go on and see and attend from there on out. I will be able to delete an event that I am no longer interested 
in going if I change my mind on whether or not I want to go or if plans change.
