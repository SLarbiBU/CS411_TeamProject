User Story #3

As a logged-in user, I want to find recommendations on what I can do within my certain budget. 

The user will open up the web application, and will be asked to log in with their Google account, as detailed in the user log in story. After the user has logged in, they will be presented with an option to pick a particular price point. The user will then be presented with a selection (filtered via profile sign up information) of various parts of their night out that fall within their budget: What to Do, Where to Eat, How to Get There via the uber estimate provided for the event. The user can select their preference in each category to create an overall experience. The user will be presented with an overall estimated budget and can either click to go on this adventure, and be presented with an itinerary, or to start again, in whichcase they will be taken back to the beginning page.
