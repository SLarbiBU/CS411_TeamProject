We chose the Node.js/Express.js frameworks for the backend of our web app. The three mains stacks/languages we considered were Node, Flask, and Go. 
If we were to use Go, the benefit would be performance and customizability of the server, since Go performs well when used to write code for servers
and concurrent tasks. However, none of the team members have knowledge of Go, so the learning curve would have been very steep. Furthermore, there
are not many frameworks in Go currently available which have gained popularity and have many resources. Therefore, we determined that using Go
would have been too complex and time consuming given our timeline. 
We ultimately chose Node/Express over Flask due to familiarity with the stack compared to Flask. Several members of the group had worked with Node
and had completed projects using Node. While most team members knew Python, we decided that the extra time that would be required to learn the Flask
framework would be tough to fit into the schedule. Furthermore, Node/Express have many different tutorials online which would quickly fill any
gaps in our knowledge. Finally, we decided it would be best to use the same language on the backend and frontend. We figured that it would be easier
for the backend and front end to communicate with each other if they were written in the same language. Furthermore, using one language would reduce
how much time would be spent on reviewing syntax and things of that nature. 
For front end, we chose to use Angular 5. For the frontend, we wanted to use some sort of front end javascript framework to make the manipulation
and display of data easier. We ended up choosing between Angular and React, largely due to their popularity in the field and the amount
of resources available online. We chose to use Angular 5 because some people had previous experience working with Angular, so the learning 
curve would not be as steep.
