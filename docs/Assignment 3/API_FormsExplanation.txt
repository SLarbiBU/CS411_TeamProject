For this part of the assignment, we created a node/express server with several different routes. These routes were used to fetch information
from the OpenWeatherMap and Eventbrite APIs. For the weather page, both the weather forecast and the current weather for the supplied city
was displayed. The routes are under weather.js. Later in the project, these routes were updated to take the latitude and longitude of the 
location instead of the city name. 
The eventbrite page allows the user to pick how much money they want to spend on an event and then fetches different events which fit that
criteria from the event brite api. The routes used to call the api are in pricePoint.js.
