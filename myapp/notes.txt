Running the app after pulling down the latest copy from github (assuming you have latest version of node):
1) I think we'll need to run npm install in the project directory in order to make sure we all have the proper
packages locally - packages are included in gitignore and arent pushed to github
2) Use the commands shown in https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html to actually run the app


Building the App:

1) Got the most recent stable version of node (I used 8.10.0)
    -website has instructions: www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/update-node-js-latest-version/
    -essentially forwards you to this website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) Used express generator to make skeleton app with pug view engine
    -just followed tutorial here: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html
3) Made a .gitignore file 
4) Made a config.js file for API keys and other config info


Adding to the App:

Changing app.js:
1) To add a router, follow the example around line 10
    var weatherRouter = require('./routes/weather');
2) Then need to use the router, follow the example around line 
    app.use('/weather', weatherRouter);

Making a new router:
1) Create new file in the routes folder
    -make the name whatever you used for step 1 in changing app.js
2) Basically just follow the examples in the routes folder already
    -when getting the response from the api, send it to a new pug template to be rendered

Making a new pug template:
1) Make new .pug file in the views folder
2) Format the page using pug
